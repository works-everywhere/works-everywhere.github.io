        Stomping environmental bugs so multi-platform software
        actually works correctly on multiple platforms
      <p>
    </header>
    <h3>What are environmental bugs? </h3>
    <p>
      An application's environment is the hardware, software, files,
      and communications it depends upon in order to get its job done.
      Environmental bugs are bugs caused by differences between the
      environments in which a multi-platform application should be able
      to run.
    </p>
    <h3> Why is this important? </h3>
    <p>
      Environmental bugs are sneaky.  It isn't feasible to test
      software under every environment in which it is in which it is
      expected to run.  This means bugs are only caught after software
      fails once it has been delivered to its users.  At this point
      its too late because
      <a href="https://github.com/valvesoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3671">
      these bugs can cause real damage.</a>
    </p>
    <h3> How? </h3>
    <p>
      Our goal is to construct tools that help developers more easily
      identify when their software may be vulnerable to anomalous
      environments.  First, this means tools that can analyze an
      application at rest or in action in order to provide feedback
      about how an application might be vulnerable.  Second, this
      means tools that can easily and efficiently simulate weird
      environments in order to prove that an application fails as
      predicted so effort is not wasted on false positives.
